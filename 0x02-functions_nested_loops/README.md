0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

GENERAL NOTES

//No use of  global variables
//No use of the standard library
//Use _putchar
//Use 'main.h'
0. _putchar - Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line. The program should return 0.
1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game. Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);. You can only use _putchar twice in your code.
